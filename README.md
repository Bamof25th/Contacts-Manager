# Contacts-Manager
 used express to set up the server.   ● have used persistent storage and set up MongoDB. ● We have used different functions of the MongoDB using mongoose to add a contact,to fetch the list of contacts, and to delete a contact.
 so it was a minor projrct to learn node and express JS with  mongoose as a data base (backend)
